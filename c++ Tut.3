//////C++ Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values.

///////In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

    int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
    double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
    char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
    string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
    bool - stores values with two states: true or false

///////Declaring (Creating) Variables

To create a variable, specify the type and assign it a value:

#Syntax
type variableName = value;

Where type is one of C++ types (such as int), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or myName). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.

////Create a variable called myNum of type int and assign it the value 15

//////  Code //////
int myNum = 15;
cout << myNum;

You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later

////// Code //////
int myNum;
myNum = 15;
cout << myNum;

////// Changing Variable Values
Note that if you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value:

////// Code ///////
int myNum = 15;  // myNum is 15
myNum = 10;  // Now myNum is 10
cout << myNum;  // Outputs 10 

////// Declare Many Variables
To declare more than one variable of the same type, use a comma-separated list:

/////Code/////

int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;
cout << x + y + z;

/////One Value to Multiple Variables
You can also assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:

///// Code /////
int x, y, z;
x = y = z = 50;
cout << x + y + z;
