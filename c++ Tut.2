/////// PRINT TEXT

The cout object, together with the << operator, is used to output values and print text.

Just remember to surround the text with double quotes (""):

You can add as many cout objects as you want. However, note that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:

////// Code ///////

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main (){
cout<< "Programming is interesting";
cout<< " So are you";
return 0 ;
}

////// PRINT NUMBERS



///// CODE //////

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
cout<< 3;
cout<< 3+5;
cout<< 5*8;
return 0;
}

////// New Lines

1) To insert a new line in your output, you can use the \n character
2) You can also use another << operator and place the \n character after the text
3) Two \n characters after each other will create a blank line
4) Another way to insert a new line, is with the endl manipulator

Both \n and endl are used to break lines. However, \n is most used.
But what is \n exactly?

The newline character (\n) is called an escape sequence, and it forces the cursor to change its position to the beginning of the next line on the screen. This results in a new line.

Examples of other valid escape sequences are:
Escape Sequence 	               Description 	
\t 	                             Creates a horizontal tab 	
\\ 	                             Inserts a backslash character (\) 	
\" 	                             Inserts a double quote character

////// CODE ////////
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
cout<< "Using backslash n inside the double semicolon \n";
cout<< "Using backslash n outside the double semicolon" <<"\n";
cout<< "Using double backslash n creates a blank space" <<"\n\n";
cout<< "Using endl to end the line"<<endl;
return 0 ;
}
