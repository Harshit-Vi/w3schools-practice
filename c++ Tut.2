/////// PRINT TEXT

The cout object, together with the << operator, is used to output values and print text.

Just remember to surround the text with double quotes (""):

You can add as many cout objects as you want. However, note that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:

////// Code ///////

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main (){
cout<< "Programming is interesting";
cout<< " So are you";
return 0 ;
}

////// PRINT NUMBERS



///// CODE //////

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
cout<< 3;
cout<< 3+5;
cout<< 5*8;
return 0;
}
